h1. Ruby FTK Toolkit

This is a ruby library for manipulating the output of Forensic Toolkit (http://accessdata.com/products/computer-forensics/ftk). It was built for a project called Hypatia (http://wiki.duraspace.org/display/HYPAT/Charter) but can be used elsewhere. It makes certain assumptions about how FTK outputs data, which will be documented here soon.

The XML output that FTK creates is an XML-FO document that isn't easy to read or understand. This library can do that for you. To turn an FTK report into something that's easier to work with, follow this example:

<pre>
	<code>
		require 'ruby_ftk_toolkit'
		
      	report = File.join(File.dirname(__FILE__), "/spec/fixtures/Gould_FTK_Report.xml")
		ftk_processor = FtkProcessor.new(:ftk_report => report)
      	
		# You can get collection level data 
		ftk_processor.collection_title # => "Stephen Jay Gould papers"
		ftk_processor.call_number 	# => "M1437"
		ftk_processor.series # => "Series 6: Born Digital Materials"
		ftk_processor.file_count # => "56"
		
		# And you can get file level data in the form of FtkFile objects
		ftk_processor.files.each do |ftk_file|
			puts ftk_file[1].filename
			puts ftk_file[1].id
			puts ftk_file[1].md5
    	end
	</code>
</pre>

You might want to create BagIt packages for each file from your FTK output:
<pre>
	<code>
	# Assemble FTK output into objects for Hypatia. 
	my_fedora_config = "/path/to/fedora.yml"
	my_bag_dir = "/path/to/where/my/bags/should/be/created"
	ftk_report = "/path/to/FTK_Report.xml"
	file_dir = "/path/to/exported/ftk/file/directory"
	hfo = HypatiaFileObjectAssembler.new(:fedora_config => my_fedora_config, :bag_destination => my_bag_dir)
	hfo.process(ftk_report, file_dir)
	</code>
</pre>
